## **Workshop Overview** {#workshop-overview}

This 2-hour workshop introduces participants (ages 14+) to programming and data visualization using real-world **weather and climate data** from NOAA. Participants work with a **pre-written Python script in Google Colab** to create their own visualizations, with options to explore global temperature, wind, precipitation patterns and more.

No prior programming knowledge is required. Participants can either follow the script step-by-step or experiment freely, depending on their interest and skill level.

Your role as instructor is to:

* Guide participants through technical setup and the code walkthrough

* Support debugging and answer coding questions

* Provide scientific context for the visualizations (climate phenomena, patterns, meteorological events)

  ## **Target Audience** {#target-audience}

* Age 14+, no programming background required

* Basic familiarity with using a computer and Google tools

* Interest in science, technology, or environmental topics is helpful

  ## **Required Materials** {#required-materials}

  ### **For Participants** {#for-participants}

* Laptop (own device or provided by organizer)

* Google account (required for Colab access)

* Internet access

  ### **For Workshop Setup** {#for-workshop-setup}

* Projector/beamer

* Instructor laptop with access to Colab notebook

* Smartphone/camera (optional for documentation)

* Shared access to the prepared Google Colab notebook

  ## **About the Data Source: NOAA** {#about-the-data-source:-noaa}

The **National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)** is a US scientific agency that collects and distributes high-quality weather and climate data. The dataset used in this workshop is a so called Reanalysis from NOAA and typically includes various atmospheric variables.

The prepared notebook loads a small, preprocessed subset of NOAA’s publicly available datasets (in NetCDF format) and then creates an animation from it.

## **Workshop Timeline & Instructor Notes** {#workshop-timeline-&-instructor-notes}

## 

| Phase | Time | Instructor Goals | Actions & Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1\. Welcome** | 0–10 min | Break the ice and set the tone | Greet participants, introduce yourself, briefly explain the workshop. Ask: Who has coded before? Who's into weather/climate? |
| **2\. Context & Motivation** | 10–20 min | Explain the “why” behind the workshop | Discuss relevance of weather visualization and programming. |
| **3\. Technical Setup** | 20–30 min | Get all devices ready, ensure everyone can run code | Assist with logging in, opening Colab, verifying the code loads and runs |
| **4\. Code Walkthrough** | 30–70 min | Ensure understanding of how the script works | Go step-by-step through the notebook, explain structure and what each block does. Make the participants follow you on their on computers. Pause for questions, help with bugs |
| **5\. Independent Work** | 70–100 min | Support creative exploration of the data | Participants choose data types to visualize and create their own maps. Encourage variation: wind fields, surface temperature, rainfall, etc. Provide interpretation help: point out interesting patterns (e.g., hurricanes, wind belts) |
| **6\. Presentation & Reflection** | 100–115 min | Facilitate sharing and discussion | Ask for volunteers to present their results on the projector; initiate discussion on what they see. Optional: Participants can take artistic photos in the projection. |
| **7\. Wrap-up** | 115–120 min | Reflect, collect feedback, end on a positive note | Recap what was learned, invite feedback, and thank participants |

### **Programming Notes** {#programming-notes}

The instructor should understand the code very well, especially the limits (e.g. only data for specific years are possible to download)  so that he/she will be able to fix errors as fast as possible. 

### 

### **Scientific Support** {#scientific-support}

You don’t need to be a meteorologist—but having a basic understanding of the following will help:

* **Jet streams**

* **Tropical storms / hurricanes**

* **Global wind belts (e.g. trade winds, westerlies)**

* **Precipitation patterns and the ITCZ (Intertropical Convergence Zone)**

Use visuals to highlight these phenomena and encourage curiosity.

### **Pedagogical Notes** {#pedagogical-notes}

* Let participants move at their own pace: some will stick to the default script, others may try custom tweaks

* Encourage experimentation: changing colors, time ranges, or even combining datasets

* Provide positive feedback even for small achievements

* Allow breaks if needed—especially during the coding phase
