## **Objective** {#objective}

Visitors (students, parents, or anyone interested) should be able to:

* Interact in a playful and low-threshold way with real weather data visualizations

* Create their own weather animation – e.g., for a specific date like their birthday

* Receive their animation via email if desired

## **Booth Setup** {#booth-setup}

| Item | Description |
| :---- | ----- |
| **Laptop \+ Screen or Beamer** | Displays the Google Colab Notebook |
| **Colab Notebook** | Opened in advance – ready for user input |
| **Visitor Interface** | A clearly marked section in the notebook: input field for date, and a button to run the code |
| **Email List** | Paper or digital form for visitors to write down their email address, if they want to receive their animation later |
| **Staff Member** | Briefly explains the project, helps with input and questions |

## **Visitor Flow** {#visitor-flow}

### **1\. Short Welcome & Explanation (1–2 minutes)** {#1.-short-welcome-&-explanation-(1–2-minutes)}

* "Here you can create a real weather animation using data from the US climate agency NOAA."

* "For example, choose your birthday – we’ll show you what the weather looked like on that day around the world."

### **2\. Interactive Input** {#2.-interactive-input}

* Visitors run the script (in its fully automated version).

* The notebook asks a few questions (e.g., "Which variable would you like to plot?").

### **3\. Viewing the Result** {#3.-viewing-the-result}

* The animation or map is generated (this may take a few minutes, depending on settings).

* View the animation together, explain what is shown, and highlight interesting features (e.g., storms, jet streams, ITCZ).

### **4\. Take It Home via Email (optional)** {#4.-take-it-home-via-email-(optional)}

* Visitors write down their email address on a list (or directly in the notebook if automated).

* The animation is sent to them after the event as a `.gif` or `.mp4`.

## **Staff Member – Responsibilities** {#staff-member-–-responsibilities}

* Greet visitors and spark interest

* Explain how to run the code and how to respond to the input prompts

* Provide help if needed (e.g., browser issues, no output, error messages)

* Answer questions about weather phenomena or the code itself

* Collect email addresses securely (in compliance with data protection regulations)
