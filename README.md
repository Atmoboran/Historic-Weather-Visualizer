# Weather Visualization and Animation Notebook

This project automates the visualization and animation of weather data using NOAA datasets. The notebook allows users to download weather data, process it, and create animated visualizations for various weather variables like temperature, humidity, and more.

## Jupyter Notebooks

*Wettervisuals_full_automated_RAM.ipynb*:
This is the fully automated version of the weather visualization script. In this version, you only need to answer a few questions at the beginning. Once the questions are answered, you can simply run all cells in the notebook at once to download, process, and visualize the data. After answering all questions, scroll all the way down to look at the animation. You can also download the animation by clicking on the folder button on the left. There you should find your animation, if you have set the option to save as mp4 to 'yes'.

*Wettervisuals_interactive_workshop.ipynb*:
This is the interactive, step-by-step edition of the script, where users are guided to set constants and options themselves as they progress through the script. It’s ideal for those who want to understand the underlying processes in greater depth and gain hands-on experience with data handling and visualization.
